# Recommender System Models

This repository contains code for various models used in building a recommender system. The project is aimed at exploring different algorithms and techniques for providing personalized recommendations based on user behavior and item characteristics.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to implement and evaluate different recommender system models. These models analyze user-item interactions to predict items that a user is likely to find interesting or useful, enhancing the user experience on platforms such as e-commerce websites, streaming services, and more.

### Key Models Covered

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Uses user-item interaction data to recommend items by finding similar users or items.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends items similar to those the user has interacted with, based on item features.
- **Hybrid Models**: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering to improve recommendation accuracy.
- **Matrix Factorization Techniques**: Utilizes methods like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to discover latent factors in the data that explain user preferences.

## Files in the Repository

- **`Recommender-System-Models.ipynb`**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the complete implementation of the recommender system models. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison of different approaches.
